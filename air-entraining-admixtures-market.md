<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air-Entraining Admixtures Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-Entraining Admixtures without Chloride</li><li>Air-Entraining Admixtures with Chloride</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The air-entraining admixtures market is divided into two main types: air-entraining admixtures without chloride and those with chloride. Air-entraining admixtures without chloride are used to prevent corrosion in concrete, making them suitable for environments sensitive to chloride exposure, such as coastal areas. In contrast, air-entraining admixtures with chloride enhance workability and performance, particularly in cold-weather applications where they help reduce freezing and thawing damage. Both types improve concrete durability by incorporating microscopic air bubbles, enhancing resistance to damage from freeze-thaw cycles.</p></p>
