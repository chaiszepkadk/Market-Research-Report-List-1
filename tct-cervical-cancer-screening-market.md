<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TCT Cervical Cancer Screening Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li> Conventional Pap Smear</li><li>Liquid-Based Cytology </li></ul></p>
<p><p>The TCT Cervical Cancer Screening market primarily includes two types: Conventional Pap Smear and Liquid-Based Cytology (LBC). The Conventional Pap Smear involves collecting cells from the cervix, which are then examined under a microscope for abnormalities. Liquid-Based Cytology, on the other hand, also collects cervical cells but preserves them in a liquid medium, allowing for better cell preservation and reducing contamination. This advancement enhances diagnostic accuracy and has driven a shift towards LBC in cervical cancer screening practices.</p></p>
