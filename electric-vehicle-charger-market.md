<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Vehicle Charger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-board Charger</li><li>Off-board Charger</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric vehicle (EV) charger market consists of two main types: on-board chargers and off-board chargers. On-board chargers are integrated into the vehicle, enabling it to convert AC power from public charging stations or home outlets into DC power for the battery. These chargers typically have lower power ratings, allowing for slower charging. Off-board chargers, on the other hand, are stand-alone units located outside the vehicle, capable of delivering higher power levels for quicker charging times, ideal for commercial and public infrastructure.</p></p>
